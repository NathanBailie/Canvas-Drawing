# CSS Canvas Drawing

## Description
An idea for this project I have found from a 30 day [challenge](https://javascript30.com/) where you complete 1 project each day in vanilla JavaScript. I I improved the original project by adding the ability to change line width and color, line start and end styles, and the ability to clear the canvas
